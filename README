Code organisation:

The solver's internal structures are built around the DIMACS format; it's used
natively for speed.

The code is mostly self-explanatory: `pp' is pretty-printing, `init' are
constructors, `assign' refer to single assignments, and `assignment' to
multiple assignments.

The data structures are the clause, the formula, and a reversal structure
(which allows one to *undo* the effects of an assignment). This is created at
the same time that an assignment is done; order must be maintained for
reversibility.

dpll_inner is the primary function; the externally callable `dpll' is a
convenience wrapper around it. pureliterals and unitclauses are the base
heuristics of the algorithm itself.

Note that issat and isunsat are early-termination heuristics; they could
both be simultaneously true.
